# Digital Roadmap

The goal of this feature is to provide tailored forward-looking roadmap information to RHEL customers, as well as providing tailored information on how current RHEL minor and major releases will affect the customers environment.

This will enable customers to confidently understand the impact of upgrading systems (for both minor and major releases) in their environment (including positive and negative impacts), and will enable them to better understand what is coming in future RHEL releases so that they can better plan and provide feedback to Red Hat early if needed.


## Getting started

Please access our CONTRIBUTING.md file for instructions on getting setup.
